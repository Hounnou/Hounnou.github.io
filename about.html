<p>I am a Fulbright scholar with over eight years of experience specializing in complex data 
problem management. During my tenure as a research and teaching assistant at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, I successfully contributed to various projects involving the
development and validation of models. Specifically, I focused on creating and implementing
innovative algorithms to predict market trends. Additionally, I worked extensively on designing
loss forecasting and stress testing models for credit cards and unsecured lending. My
dissertation revolved around the application of Bayesian Deep Learning to model key metrics
such as Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).</p>

<p>My areas of expertise include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Predictive Modelling, Econometrics and Financial Risk Management. I have a strong background
in Economics, Programming and Statistics. I am well versed in data cleaning, data manipulation, descriptive statistics and model interpretation using time series analysis, 
cross-sectional and panel data analysis, causal inference, spatial econometrics and Bayesian statistics. I am conversant with many programming languages including R, Python, SAS,STATA, Java and GIS.</p>

<p>My PhD dissertation is about using Machine Learning
techniques to solve real life problems in Education and Finance. 
In that endeavor, I compared Bayesian deep learning approach for credit risk modelling to commonly 
used approaches at financial institutions.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I developed and deployed models on credit card fraud detection,
customer behavior analysis, the likelihood of marketing engagement and many more.
