<p>I am pursuing a double major in Applied Statistics and Informatics. 
I hold a master's degree in Applied Economics from Oklahoma State University, USA. I have 
more than eight years of experience managing complex data problems, especially in Finance.</p>

<p>My areas of expertise include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Predictive Modelling, Econometrics and Financial Risk Management. I have a strong background
in Economics, Programming and Statistics. I am well versed in data cleaning, data manipulation, descriptive statistics and model interpretation using time series analysis, 
cross-sectional and panel data analysis, causal inference, spatial econometrics and Bayesianstatistics. I am conversant with many programming languages including R, Python, SAS,STATA, Java and GIS.</p>

<p>My PhD dissertation is about using Machine Learning
techniques to solve real life problems in Education and Finance. 
In that endeavor, I compared Bayesian deep learning approach for credit risk modelling to commonly 
used approaches at financial institutions.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I developed and deployed models on credit card fraud detection,
customer behavior analysis, the likelihood of marketing engagement and many more.
