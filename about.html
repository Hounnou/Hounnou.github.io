<p> I am a quantitative risk professional with over a decade of experience in model development, 
    validation, and governance across the banking, insurance, and academic research sectors. 
    My expertise spans data science, Model Risk Management, and predictive analytics, with a 
    deep understanding of the model lifecycle and its alignment with regulatory frameworks such as 
    SR 11-7, OCC 2011-12, and DFAST. I have worked extensively on an array of models, including 
    credit loss forecasting, stress testing, market risk, capital adequacy, and advanced machine 
    learning applications for fraud detection and Anti-Money Laundering (AML).</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have applied a wide range of statistical and machine learning techniques, 
    including time series analysis, panel data modeling, Bayesian inference, and Natural Language Processing. 
    My hands-on experience also comprises preparing and profiling large-scale datasets, building predictive 
    models for claims, credit, and fraud, and validating models to ensure compliance with internal standards 
    and regulatory expectations. My doctoral research focused on Bayesian Deep Learning to estimate critical 
    credit risk metrics such as Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default
     (EAD), bridging theoretical innovation with real-world application.</p>

<p>My core areas of expertise include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Econometrics, 
    and Financial Risk Management. I am proficient in a diverse set of tools and programming languages, including 
    Python, R, SAS, STAT, JavaScript, LaTeX, and GIS. This technical versatility enables me to develop, deploy, and 
    interpret complex models across various platforms while effectively communicating insights to both technical and 
    non-technical stakeholders.</p>
