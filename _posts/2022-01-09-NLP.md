### Summary

 Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) wich combines Linguistics and Computer Science. It gives computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way as human beings. Also referred to as Computational Linguistics, its implementation involves the combination of Statisctics, Machine Learning an Deep Learning. In real life, it has many applications including sentiment analysis, language translation,  voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots and many more. In this project, I used Naive Bayes model (a machine learning algorithm) to classify spam messages. The model is 95% accurate. It was developped in **Python**.
